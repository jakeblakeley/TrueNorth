### Virtual Lessons

Here’s how our virtual lesson system works for you:

We kick things off with a video call to get to know you and your pup! During this call, we’ll chat about your current situation, training goals, and if you’re new to Google Drive we will walk you through how we use it to keep everything organized and at your fingertips.

Next, we’ll break your goals down into clear, manageable steps, set realistic timelines, and build a lesson schedule that keeps you on track. These ongoing lessons are a great chance to prepare for specific situations—whether it’s guests coming over, an upcoming competition, or that vet visit on the calendar.

After our initial call, I’ll organize all your personalized materials into a Google folder so everything’s ready to go. The only thing you’ll need to keep updated is your training tracker!

Got a question between lessons? You’ll have a dedicated notes section where you can jot down thoughts anytime. Quick clarifications can be handled between sessions, but anything bigger will be saved for our next lesson.
