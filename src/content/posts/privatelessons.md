### Create Your One-on-One Training Plan
At True North we offer training tailored to both everyday manners and competitive dog sports. Our Manners lessons focus on essential at-home skills like loose leash walking, polite greetings, and managing reactivity, helping your dog become a well-behaved companion for life! For dog sport enthusiasts, our foundation training builds the focus, control, and teamwork needed for success in any sport, with customized support to prepare teams for stepping into a competition! 

### Manners Lessons 
At True North we offer personalized dog training that is rooted in real-life situations, not just obedience drills in a classroom. 
Our Manners program is designed to help you build practical, everyday manners that truly matter in your world. From peaceful, polite leash walking, to calm relaxed car rides, we teach your dog how to navigate the world alongside you. These are one hour in-person lessons at your home or in public! 

You can learn how to get your dog’s offered attention without begging for it, how to handle them happily for grooming and vet visits, and how to clearly communicate what you need—without frustration on either side. 

Whether your dog struggles with reactivity toward other dogs or people, gets overly rough during play, or has trouble calming down in stimulating environments, we’re here to help. We place a strong focus on addressing behavioral issues by helping you troubleshoot those big, emotional outbursts with practical, step-by-step strategies and an understanding of what the root cause is! 

Our training is completely tailored to your lifestyle, so whether you’re hiking trails, managing city sidewalks, or wrangling kids and a family dog, we’ll help you create lasting behavior that fits your life, not someone else’s!
