### Enhance Your Training Journey! 

We’re excited to offer services designed to support our current dog training clients and make life a little easier for busy owners! These add-on options, available only to clients actively enrolled in lessons, are tailored to reinforce your dog’s progress outside of training sessions while providing convenience and peace of mind. Whether it’s structured training field trips or board and training from our home these services are here to elevate your experience and help your dog succeed in real-world situations! 

### Field Trips
#### Come Home To A Well Trained Dog

Come Home To A Well Trained Dog
After creating a training plan with you in lessons, field trips are a supplementary service where we come to your home and pick up your dog, and practice training with your dog for you, even while you're at work! 

These are full one hour working sessions!  

Our in-home or in public field trip program provides one of the most convenient paths available to a well-trained dog.
How Does It Work?

We Pick Your Brain: In our lessons we’ll determine your priorities, and design a custom training plan to meet your needs.
Let Us Do The Work: We'll train your dog, either in your home or take them with us to practice in public, 1 day each week. You’re welcome to watch if you’re home, but we don’t involve you much. Most of our clients are at work during these sessions.

We Train You: In our lessons it’s your turn to learn to maintain and build upon what we taught your dog!

Field Trips are Particularly Beneficial For
* Working settling and urban dog skills in new public places
Teaching dogs to walk politely on-leash in your neighborhood

* Puppy exposure and socialization opportunities

* Working on manners inside and outside the home
Expanding reactive dogs to new places and experiences

### Board and Trains
#### Going Out of Town? Let Us Do Your Homework For You! 

Your dog can come stay in our home with us! Immersing your dog in our routine, which includes daily doses of structure, training sessions, adventures in new places, enrichment, and play! We pick up and drop off your dog, give you regular photo and video updates, and work on the skills your pup needs! 

The board & train experience is a program that immerses your dog 24/7 in our training routine! This is a great option for owners who are trying to start their puppy off on the right foot, or can’t dedicate the focused time to addressing complaint behaviors. By living at our home, your dog will develop a new foundation and state-of-mind that will make it easy for you to continue the training at your home. Then you can continue developing a new and incredible relationship with your dog in new exciting places! A consult will need to take place at least a month prior to the board & train.

Each Board & Train is custom to your life! 

This program includes a 30-minute consultation,  follow-up at the end of the stay where we will transfer all of the information, techniques, and strategies to you to ensure continued success!
