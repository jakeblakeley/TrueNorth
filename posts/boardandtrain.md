### Building Foundations With an Experienced Hand 
The board &amp; train experience is a program that is effective by immersing your dog 24/7 in our training routine, which includes daily doses of structure, new behaviors, exposure in new places, and play. This is a great option for owners who are trying to start their puppy off on the right foot, or can’t dedicate the focused time to addressing complaint behaviors. Those that want to improve their canine-human relationship, but aren’t sure how. By living at my home, your dog will develop a new foundation and state-of-mind that will make it easy for you to continue the training at your home. Then you can continue developing a new and incredible relationship with your dog in new exciting places! A consult will need to take place at least a month prior to the board &amp; train.


### Each Board &amp; Train is Custom
Some examples of things that can be covered are: 

- Walk politely with you On-Leash

- Sit/Stay
