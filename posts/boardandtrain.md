The Board and Train experience is a program that is effective by immersing your dog 24/7 in our training routine, which includes daily doses of structure, new behaviors, exposure in new places, and play. This is a great option for owners who are trying to start their puppy off on the right foot, or can’t dedicate the focused time to addressing complaint behaviors. Those that want to improve their canine-human relationship, but aren’t sure how. By living at my home, your dog will develop a new foundation and state-of-mind that will make it easy for you to continue the training at your home. Then you can continue developing a new and incredible relationship with your dog in new exciting places! A consult will need to take place at least a month prior to the board and train.

Though each board and train is custom for the dog, some examples of things that can be covered are: 

- Walk politely with you On-Leash

- Sit/Stay

- Down/Stay

- Place Command

- Recall/Come

- Crate Training

- Waiting for Food

- Appropriate Play

- Waiting at Thresholds (Doors, Car, Crate, etc.)


We can also focus on any minor behavior issues, such as:

- Jumping, Nipping, Mouthing

- Demand Barking 

- Counter-Surfing


This program includes a 30-minute consultation on our starting day, a 90 minute follow-up at the end of the program where we will transfer all of the information, techniques, and strategies to you to ensure continued success. 

For more intensive behavior issues; reactivity, anxiety, etc. longer board and train options are available.
