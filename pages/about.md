Jacelyn Young has always been passionate about the science behind animal behavior and training. She has worked professionally with dogs for over a decade, helping others while continuously learning and competing with her personal dogs in various canine-oriented sports. Under the guidance of mentors across North America, she combined her love for entrepreneurship and dog training to create True North.

Her favorite part of dog training is building a foundation for communication, not only between two species but also in how we communicate with other people. Jacelyn aims to **deconstruct behaviors into easy-to-understand building blocks**, creating a foundation for training that is easily replicated and understood fluently by professionals, hobbyists, and everyday owners alike.

Jacelyn has been involved in dog sports since 2010, competing with her Belgian Malinois, Naru and Caicos, and her Hungarian Mudi, Qatar. Together, they have trained and titled in Agility, Rally, French Ringsport, and Disc. Most recently, she earned a **French Ring 1** and **Disc Dog Bronze title** with her two-year-old Belgian Malinois, Caicos, using entirely reward-based training methods.

When Jacelyn isnâ€™t actively training or educating herself on the latest dog behavior and training methods, she can be found traveling internationally, rock climbing, hiking, or taking pet portraits. She is an Accredited Dog Trainer through the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, an AKC CGC Evaluator, and an active student with the Fenzi Dog Sports Academy. She completed her graduate program in **Applied Animal Behavior at the University of Washington** in June 2024 and is a **UW-certified Applied Animal Behaviorist**.
